# Basic-Pytorch-Neural-Network-with-Iris-dataset (Part of assignment)

-The main goal is to develop a model capable of classifying an iris plant based on four features. This is a multi-class classification where each sample can belong to ONE of 3 classes (Iris setosa, Iris virginica or Iris versicolor). The network will have 4 input neurons (flower dimensions) and 3 output neurons (scores). Our loss function will compare the target label (ground truth) to the corresponding output score

    -create a multi-layer deep learning model
    -load data
    -train and validate the model
    
    /Finally, Apply the model to classify new, unseen dataÂ¶



    Accuracy with test dataset> 96.06 percentage.
